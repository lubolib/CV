# **Projects (2014-2020)**

### **Design of 32 × 32 GaN Mini-LED Display System**
* The driving circuit (PCB) and display circuit (FPC) designed by Altium Designer were combined with custom made FPGA to demonstrate a Blue Mini-LED display system. Flip-chip technology was used to fabricate 1024 LED chips by transfer bonding each pixel on solder paste precisely.

### **Studies of Thermal Stability of Flexible Transparent Mini-LED Array**
* The studies of the color change and thermal distribution of a flexible and transparent 32×32 mini-LED array on PET substrate up to a brightness rating of 5000 nits at room temperature was presented. The calculated color differences from the EL spectra at three different brightness are far less than the color discrimination threshold of the human eye corresponding to 0.005 at all testing brightness and meet the display industry requirement for color difference.

### **Fabrication of GaN/InGaN Micro-LED**
* The InGaN/GaN epitaxy wafer was covered by photoresist and SiO2 partially, and ICP system was used to etch mesa for n-contact. After removing the SiO2, the Ni/Au was used to spread the current. After the current spread layer, electrodes were made for current injection.

### **Undergraduate (2014 / 09  - 2018 / 07)**
* Participating in the 13th May Day Mathematical Modeling League in 2017. Mainly responsible for 
  * Analyzing the problem and establishing the model; 
  * Building the model with Matlab, analyzing and processing the data.
